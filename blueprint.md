## Plan for Current Change

- Remove the gray background from the welcome section on `index.html`.
- Add a white horizontal line below the welcome section for separation.

## Changes Made

- Removed the `bg-secondary` class from the welcome section div in `index.html`.
- Added an `<hr class="mt-3 bg-light">` tag after the welcome section div in `index.html` to create a white separator line.
